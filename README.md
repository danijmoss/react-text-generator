# ReactJS Sample Text Generator

An app that creates paragraph text with or without the HTML paragraph tag (<p>). This app was made following the [Build & Deploy A React JS Text Generator App tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU5DYccb77A&t=296s) on the YouTube channel [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

The app was using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), the [Minty theme](https://bootswatch.com/minty/) from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/), and the [Bacon Ipsum JSON API](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/).
